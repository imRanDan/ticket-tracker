# Ticket Tracker App
A webapp designed to assign work/project-related tickets. The user can choose the subject, description, severity level, and the user that the ticket is assigned to. ChanceJS is used to render a ticket ID.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML - CSS - Bootstrap - ChanceJS - JavaScript

I wanted to practice working with a CSS framework [BootStrap] to get a good looking interface going. I also wanted to practice and apply my skills to created a functioning CRUD application

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

If I had more time, I would have made the CSS look better. I think BootStrap is fine to start but I would come back and use Tailwind CSS to make it look even better.

I would also implement an MVC backend framework to make this a full-stack application, as this would make things more secure and official

## Lessons Learned:

Working with ChanceJS was interesting to render it as a ticket issue ID. I found working with BootStrap was nice and simple. I believe that it is important to know how a Ticket Tracker would be used on a team and I feel that this is a solid project to showcase this interest.
